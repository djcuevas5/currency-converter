## Project Plan
This project is Python based smart currency converter application featuring a GUI. It allows users to convert between currencies using real time data, shows graph exchange rate trends, access economic news, and gain insights on the best time to convert (the money) based on data analysis. Therefore this application will integrate those four APIs, and display all data within the appâ€™s GUI.
